The Coyote framework can be easily installed by adding the `Microsoft.Coyote` [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Coyote/) to your C# project. You can then immediately start programming the Coyote API as shown in the [samples](http://github.com/Microsoft/CoyoteSamples).

## Build from source

### Prerequisites

- [Visual Studio 2019](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/install-visual-studio)
- [.NET Core 2.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core) also available as an optional component during the VS 2019 installation
- [.NET Framework 4.6 and 4.7](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework), as Coyote builds binaries for both 4.6 and 4.7.

- Optional: add the `DGML Editor` feature of Visual Studio 2019 in order
to view the state machine diagrams generated by the `coyote` test tool.

### Building the Coyote project

Clone the [Coyote repo](http://github.com/microsoft/coyote), then open `Coyote.sln` and build.

You can also use the following `PowerShell` command line from a Visual Studio 2019 Developer Command Prompt:

```
powershell -f .\Scripts\build.ps1
```

### Running the tests

To run all available tests, execute the following `PowerShell` command line from a Visual Studio 2019 Developer Command Prompt:

```
powershell -f .\Scripts\run-tests.ps1
```

You can also run a specific category of tests by adding the `-test` option to specify the category name, for example:

```
powershell -f .\Scripts\run-tests.ps1 -test core
```

### Building the samples

Clone the [CoyoteSamples repo](http://github.com/Microsoft/CoyoteSamples), then open the solution under `AsyncExamples` or `MachineExamples` and build.

You can also use the following `PowerShell` command line from a Visual Studio 2019 Developer Command Prompt:

```
powershell -f .\Scripts\build-examples.ps1
```

### Using a local NuGet package

The samples use the published Microsoft.Coyote NuGet package by default. If you want the samples to use the same Coyote bits you built from the Coyote repo, then edit the Nuget.config file and uncomment the following line:
```xml
<add key="Coyote" value="..\Coyote\bin\nuget"/>
```

Then in the Coyote project run this `PowerShell` command line from a Visual Studio 2019 Developer Command Prompt:

```
powershell -f .\Scripts\create-nuget-packages.ps1
```

Now you can rebuild the samples and so long as the `Common\version.props` file contains the same version in both `Coyote` and `CoyoteSamples` then it will pick up your newly created NuGet package and use that. Note: this can make debugging into the Coyote runtime possible.

Now you are ready to [start using Coyote](/Coyote/learn/get-started/using-coyote).

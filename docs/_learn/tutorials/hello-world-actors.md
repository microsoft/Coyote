## Hello world example with actors

The [HelloWorldActors](http://github.com/microsoft/coyote-samples/) is a simple program to get you
started using the Coyote [actors programming
model](/coyote/learn/programming-models/actors/overview).

## What you will need

To run the Hello World Actors  example, you will need to:

- Install [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).
- Build the [Coyote project](/coyote/learn/get-started/install).
- Clone the [Coyote Samples git repo](http://github.com/microsoft/coyote-samples).

## Build the sample

Build the `coyote-samples` repo by running the following command:

```
powershell -f build.ps1
```

## Run the HelloWorldActors application

Now you can run the HelloWorldActors application:
- in .Net Core:

```
dotnet .\bin\netcoreapp2.2\HelloWorldActors.dll
```

- in .Net 4.6:

```
.\bin\net46\HelloWorldActors.exe
```

- in .Net 4.7:

```
.\bin\net47\HelloWorldActors.exe
```

**Note that in the code there is a bug** (put intentionally) that should be caught by a Coyote
assertion. The program should display the English greeting `Hello World!` exactly once (as the
first of several greetings displayed in different languages), however sometimes it displays the
English greeting `Hello World!` for a second time during the execution of `HelloWorldActors`.

With good luck you will need to run the program only a few times in order to get the buggy result,
but on average this bug happens rarely and may need many manual runs, sometimes 20 - 30, in order to
be reproduced.

The typical "normal" run will look like this:

```
C:\git\CoyoteSamples\bin\net46>HelloWorldActors
Greeting in English             : Hello World!
Greeting in Belarussian         : Прывітанне Сусвет!
Greeting in German              : Hallo Welt!
Greeting in Polish              : Witaj świecie!
Greeting in Indonesian          : Halo Dunia!
Greeting in German              : Hallo Welt!
Greeting in Bulgarian           : Здравей свят!

C:\git\CoyoteSamples\bin\net46>
```

When the error is caught, the run may look like this:

```
C:\git\CoyoteSamples\bin\net46>HelloWorldActors
Greeting in English             : Hello World!
Greeting in German              : Hallo Welt!
Greeting in Finnish             : Hei maailma!
Greeting in English             : Hello World!
Exception of type Microsoft.Coyote.Runtime.AssertionFailureException { ... Exception text here }
```

## How to reproduce the bug

There are two ways to reproduce the bug:

The first way is to run `HelloWorldActors.exe` from the command prompt repeatedly, until you finally
get this exception:

```
Greeting in English             : Hello World!
Greeting in Mongolian           : Сайн уу дэлхий!
Greeting in English             : Hello World!
Exception of type Microsoft.Coyote.Runtime.AssertionFailureException: Message: The starting Greeting in English was duplicated but this should never happen.
```

Although this is one of the simplest programs you can write with Actors, you may need to perform
many executions before getting this exception. Even in this modest example, reproducing the bug may
take you significant amount of time.

**This is where Coyote really shines**:

The second way to reproduce the bug is to run the code under `coyote test`.

From the command line you enter:

```
coyote test .\bin\net46\HelloWorldActors.exe --iterations 30
```

The result is:

```
C:\git\CoyoteSamples>coyote test .\bin\net46\HelloWorldActors.exe --iterations 30
. Testing .\bin\net46\HelloWorldActors.exe
Starting TestingProcessScheduler in process 16040

```

Thus in less than a half-second the Coyote tester has found the bug in this simple
program&mdash;something that would take many minutes if testing manually. So, even in this simple
case Coyote finds the bug tens or even hundreds of times faster. But when using Coyote for testing
much more complex, real-world systems the time savings can be even more impressive! This will give
you the ability to find out and fix even the trickiest and almost impossible to reproduce
concurrency bugs **before pushing your code to production**.

bugs](/coyote/learn/tools/testing).

## The code

This section shows how to write a program using the Coyote Actors programming model. It is
recommended that you read [Programming model: asynchronous
actors](/coyote/learn/programming-models/actors/overview) section to gain a basic understanding of
the Actors programming model before proceeding with the code below. Prior experience writing
asynchronous code using `async` and `await` is also useful and relevant. If you are not already
familiar with `async` and `await`, you can learn more in the C#
[docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/async-in-depth).

The program consists of three code files and an additional file containing the text of the "Hello
World!" greetings in 53 languages.

* `Program.cs` contains the `Main()` entry point of the application.

* `Server.cs` defines the `Server` class. This is a Coyote
  [`Actor`](/coyote/learn/programming-models/actors/overview). Every `Actor` runs concurrently with
  respect to other Actors, but individually it handles its input queue in a sequential way. When an
  event arrives, the actor dequeues that event from the input queue and handles it by executing a
  sequence of operations.

* `Client.cs` defines the `Client` class. This is a Coyote
  [`StateMachine`](/coyote/learn/programming-models/actors/state-machines). A Coyote state machine
  is a special type of `Actor` that inherits from `StateMachine` and adds `State` semantics with
  explicit information about how `Events` can trigger `State` changes in that `StateMachine`. State
  machines are actors, but also have explicit states, and state transitions.

Let's study the code in detail. You can find the full code in the [Coyote Samples git
repo](http://github.com/microsoft/coyote-samples).

Here is the code for `Server.cs`:

```c#
[OnEventDoAction(typeof(GreetMeEvent), nameof(SendGreeting))]
internal class Server : Actor
{
    internal class GreetMeEvent : Event
    {
        public ActorId Requestor;

        public GreetMeEvent(ActorId requestor)
        {
            this.Requestor = requestor;
        }
    }

    private void SendGreeting(Event e)
    {
        ActorId client = (e as GreetMeEvent).Requestor;

        var index = this.RandomInteger(Translations.LanguagesCount);
        string language = Translations.Languages[index];
        string greeting = Translations.HelloWorldTexts[language];

        this.SendEvent(client, new Client.GreetingProducedEvent() { Language = language, Greeting = greeting });
    }
}
```

The `Server` class inherits from the standard Coyote `Actor` type. Internally it defines a
`GreetMeEvent` type that inherits from the standard Coyote `Event` type. The `GreetMeEvent` event
has a `Requestor` property which contains the `ActorId` of the `Actor` that is the sender of the
event.

The `[OnEventDoAction(typeof(GreetMeEvent), nameof(SendGreeting))]` attribute on the `Server` class
specifies that any `GreetMeEvent` in the `Server`'s input queue must be processed by a call to its
`SendGreeting()` method.

The `SendGreeting()` method performs a sequence of operations:

1. Retrieves the `ActorId` of the sender from the `GreetMeEvent` object passed as parameter.

2. Gets a random number with which to index the list of all languages for which there are "Hello
   World!" translations.

3. Using this index, determines the language of the translation of the greeting that will be sent in
   response to the sender of the `GreetMeEvent`.

4. Gets the greeting using the language as a key into  `Translations.HelloWorldTexts`.

5. Finally, the `Server` sends a `GreetingProducedEvent` back to the `Client` who sent the
   `GreetMeEvent` being processed. The properties of the generated `GreetingProducedEvent` are set
   to the `language` and `greeting` determined in the steps above.

Here is the code for `Client.cs` with details elided:

```c#
internal class Client : StateMachine
{
    private TaskCompletionSource<bool> CompletionSource;
    private ActorId Server;
    private long MaxRequests = long.MaxValue;

    private long GreetMeCounter = 0;

    private const string English = "English";
    private const string HelloWorldEnglish = "Hello World!";

    internal class ConfigEvent : Event . . .

    internal class GreetingProducedEvent : Event . . .

    private class ReadyEvent : Event { }

    [Start]
    [OnEntry(nameof(InitOnEntry))]
    [OnEventGotoState(typeof(ReadyEvent), typeof(Active))]
    private class Init : State { }

    private void InitOnEntry(Event e) . . .

    [OnEntry(nameof(ClientActiveEntry))]
    [OnEventDoAction(typeof(GreetingProducedEvent), nameof(HandleGreeting))]
    private class Active : State { }

    private void ClientActiveEntry() . . .

    private void HandleGreeting(Event e) . . .

    private void RequestGreeting() . . .

    private void TerminateMachines() . . .
}
```

The `Client` has two states: `Init` and `Active`.

It defines a number of events: `ConfigEvent`, `ReadyEvent` and `GreetingProducedEvent`. The client
also uses the `GreetMeEvent` that is defined by the `Server`

The `Client` has three members:

* `ActorId Server` - the id of the `Server` to which to send events.
* `long MaxRequests` - how many requests for greetings (`GreetMeEvent` events) to send to the
  `Server` before finishing work.
* `TaskCompletionSource<bool> CompletionSource` - a standard .NET
  [`TaskCompletionSource`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.tasks.taskcompletionsource-1?view=netframework-4.7.2)
  that is used to indicate when all asynchronous work instigated by the Client has completed, so
  that the external creator of the `Client` can wait for the completion of the work of the system.

Upon creation of the `Client` (by code in `Program.cs`), its first, initial, starting state is
`Init`, as marked by the `[Start]` attribute, and the first method to be executed is `InitOnEntry()`
as specified on another attribute of the `Init` state:

`[OnEntry(nameof(InitOnEntry))]`

The `InitOnEntry()` method receives as payload a `ConfigEvent`, and it uses `ConfigEvent`'s members
to set the members of the `Client` object:

```c#
private void InitOnEntry(Event e)
{
    ConfigEvent configEvent = e as ConfigEvent;
    this.CompletionSource = configEvent.CompletionSource;
    this.Server = configEvent.OtherParty;
    this.MaxRequests = configEvent.MaxRequests;

    this.RaiseEvent(new ReadyEvent());
}
```

The method above raises a `ReadyEvent`. As specified by this attribute of the `Init` state:

```c#
[OnEventGotoState(typeof(ReadyEvent), typeof(Active))]
```

receiving the `ReadyEvent` causes a transition to a new state, the `Active` state:

```c#
[OnEntry(nameof(ClientActiveEntry))]
[OnEventDoAction(typeof(GreetingProducedEvent), nameof(HandleGreeting))]
private class Active : State { }
```

This code specifies that on entry to the `Active` state the method `ClientActiveEntry()` is
executed. Then the only event that is expected and acted upon in the `Active` state is the
`GreetingProducedEvent`, handled by the `HandleGreeting()` method.

Here is the code of these two methods:

```c#
private void ClientActiveEntry()
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Greeting in {English, -20}: {HelloWorldEnglish}");
    this.RequestGreeting();
}
```

The only thing that the `ClientActiveEntry()` method does is to print the well-known English "Hello
World!" greeting and then call the `RequestGreeting()` method which, as its name suggests, sends a
`Server.GreetMeEvent` to the Server. The `Server` is then expected to send back to the `Client` a
`GreetingProducedEvent` that contains the language and greeting as selected from one of 53
languages. However, the `Server` must not return a greeting in English, if it does so it is a bug.

Note that your Console window may have a limited ability to display some UTF-8 characters depending
on your default Operating System language setting. For example, greetings in some non-Latin
alphabets might be displayed incorrectly on a system not setup for that. In order to see all
greetings displayed correctly, you can redirect the output to a file and then view it with your
favorite text editor that supports UTF-8 with automatic font substitution, like Visual Studio Code.

Here is the code for the `HandleGreeting()` method which is invoked when a `GreetingProducedEvent`
is received in the `Active` state:

```c#
private void HandleGreeting(Event e)
{
    try
    {
        var greeting = (GreetingProducedEvent)e;
        Console.WriteLine($"Greeting in {greeting.Language, -20}: {greeting.Greeting}");

        Specification.Assert(greeting.Language != English, $"The starting Greeting in {English} was duplicated but this should never happen.");

        this.RequestGreeting();
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Exception of type {ex.GetType()}: Message: {ex.Message}");

        this.TerminateMachines();
    }
}
```

This method simply "unpacks" the `Language` and `Greeting` from the `GreetingProducedEvent` and then
writes them on the `Console`. At this point, a Coyote `Specification.Assert()` is invoked to assert
that the language of the received greeting is not English.

If this is positive (no exception is thrown), then the `RequestGreeting()` method is called.

If the `Specification.Assert()` fails, which means that you have reproduced the bug, this raises an
exception, which is caught in the `catch` clause of the `try`/`catch` block. In the `catch` clause
the type of the exception and its `Message` are output to the `Console`. Then the
`TerminateMachines()` method is called, which terminates both the `Server` and the `Client` and
completes the `TaskCompletionSource` so that whoever waits on its `Task` is notified.

Using `Specification.Assert`, Coyote allows you to write assertions that check various kinds of
safety properties. In this case, the assertion will check whether the value of `greeting.Language`
is "English"  or not, and if it is, in production it will throw an exception, or during testing it
will report an error together with a reproducible trace.

Definitely, this `Assert` will fire sometimes because calling
`this.RandomInteger(Translations.LanguagesCount)` in the `Server` must produce a random integer in
the interval [0, `Translations.LanguagesCount`). A value of `0` for the index will cause English to
be selected as the language. Despite having this assertion here on purpose, imagine if in a real
project the programmer who wrote the code didn't read and understand the Assert properly and
violated the specification. This is a demonstration showing that Coyote assertions can be very
useful in finding some pretty tricky bugs.

The `RequestGreeting()` method is called by the `OnInitEntry` of the `Active` state to send the
first request for greeting. It is also called by the `HandleGreeting()` method to send the next
requests for greeting to the `Server`. Here is the code of `RequestGreeting()`:

```c#
private void RequestGreeting()
{
   this.GreetMeCounter++;
   if (this.GreetMeCounter >= this.MaxRequests)
    {
        // terminate the client and the server
        this.TerminateMachines();
    }
    else
    {
        this.SendEvent(this.Server, new Server.GreetMeEvent(this.Id));
    }
}
```

This simply increments the `GreetMeCounter` and checks if the specified maximum number of greetings
have already been received. If there are still some greetings to be received, a new `GreetMeEvent`
is sent to the `Server`. Notice the `GreetMeEvent` is created with the `ActorId` of the sender which
is the `Client` in this case. Thus the `Server` doesn't actually care what Actor the request comes
from, all it needs is any ActorId so it can correctly return the expected `GreetingProducedEvent`.

In case the specified maximum number of greeting requests have already been made, both the `Client`
and the `Server` are terminated by calling the `TerminateMachines()` method:

```c#
private void TerminateMachines()
{
    this.SendEvent(this.Server, HaltEvent.Instance);
    this.SendEvent(this.Id, HaltEvent.Instance);
    this.CompletionSource.SetResult(true);
}
```

This method sends a `HaltEvent.Instance` event both to the `Server` and to the `Client` itself.
Sending an instance of the `HaltEvent` to an actor (including one that is a state machine) puts them
in the `Halted` state. You can read more about the ways to terminate an actor in the [Explicit
termination of an actor](/coyote/learn/programming-models/actors/termination) documentation.

The `TerminateMachines()` method above finally sets the result (completes) the
`TaskCompletionSource` that has been provided to the `Client` by its creator, thus awakening the
`HostProgram` that is waiting on this TaskCompletionSource.

The last code file in this sample is `Program.cs`. It contains the `Main()` entry point to the
sample and an `Execute()`. This separate `Execute()` method makes Coyote testing possible:

```c#
public static class HostProgram
{
    private static long MaxGreetings = 7;

    private static readonly TaskCompletionSource<bool> CompletionSource = new TaskCompletionSource<bool>();

    public static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        if (args != null && args.Length > 0)
        {
            MaxGreetings = long.Parse(args[0]);
        }

        IActorRuntime runtime = ActorRuntimeFactory.Create();
        Execute(runtime);

        await CompletionSource.Task;
    }

    [Microsoft.Coyote.TestingServices.Test]
    public static void Execute(IActorRuntime runtime)
    {
        ActorId serverId = runtime.CreateActor(typeof(Server));
        runtime.CreateActor(typeof(Client), new Client.ConfigEvent(CompletionSource, serverId, MaxGreetings));
    }
}
```

The `Main()` entry point of the sample obtains from the command prompt the value for `MaxGreetings`,
creates an `ActorRuntime` instance and then calls the `Execute()` method passing this runtime to it.
Then it awaits on the `Task` of the (`TaskCompletionSource`) `CompletionSource` static member, which
must be completed when the sample finishes work or if any exception is caught.

The `Execute()` method creates both the `Server` actor and the `Client` state machine, then passes
to the created `Client` a `ConfigEvent` with payload containing the `Server` id, the value for
`MaxGreetings`, and the `TaskCompletionSource` on whose `Task`'s property to wait for completion.

The intent is that the code must be testable with the Coyote tester. This is done by including the
`Execute()` method and the only thing the `Main()` method does is to call this `async Execute()`
method and await its execution.

It is a rule in Coyote that for any executable to be testable with the `coyote test` tool, it must
contain a static method which must have a specific, predefined signature, such as one of these:

```c#
[Microsoft.Coyote.TestingServices.TestAttribute]
public static void Execute() { ... }

[Microsoft.Coyote.TestingServices.TestAttribute]
public static void Execute(IActorRuntime runtime) { ... }

[Microsoft.Coyote.TestingServices.TestAttribute]
public static async ControlledTask Execute() { ... await ... }

[Microsoft.Coyote.TestingServices.TestAttribute]
public static async ControlledTask Execute(IActorRuntime runtime) { ... await ... }
```

In this code one of these allowed signatures for the `Execute()` method is specified.

Do note the `[Microsoft.Coyote.TestingServices.Test]` attribute of the `Execute()` method. When this
is specified, then the Coyote tester can find the `Execute()` method in the executable assembly and
can control its execution.

Also note that **when running under the Coyote tester the `Main()` method is not executed**! This
means in our example, the test does not run with any command line arguments specifying
`MaxGreetings`. This is why we statically initialize `MaxGreetings` to an interesting number, 7 in
this example. This is a similar restriction that other unit testing frameworks have where test
parameters are either specified declaratively in custom attributes or in a config file that the test
loads.

## Microsoft.Coyote.Tasks namespace

| public type | description |
| --- | --- |
| class [AsyncLock](Microsoft.Coyote.Tasks/AsyncLockType) | A non-reentrant mutual exclusion lock that can be acquired asynchronously in a first-in first-out order. During testing, the lock is automatically replaced with a controlled mocked version. |
| class [Semaphore](Microsoft.Coyote.Tasks/SemaphoreType) | A semaphore that limits the number of tasks that can access a resource. During testing, the semaphore is automatically replaced with a controlled mocked version. |
| class [SynchronizedBlock](Microsoft.Coyote.Tasks/SynchronizedBlockType) | Provides a mechanism that synchronizes access to objects. It is implemented as a thin wrapper on Monitor. During testing, the implementation is automatically replaced with a controlled mocked version. It can be used as a replacement of the lock keyword to allow systematic testing. |
| class [Task&lt;TResult&gt;](Microsoft.Coyote.Tasks/Task-1Type) | Represents an asynchronous operation that can return a value. Each [`Task`](Microsoft.Coyote.Tasks/Task-1Type) is a thin wrapper over Task and each call simply invokes the wrapped task. During testing, a [`Task`](Microsoft.Coyote.Tasks/TaskType) is controlled by the runtime and systematically interleaved with other asynchronous operations to find bugs. |

| class [TaskCompletionSource&lt;TResult&gt;](Microsoft.Coyote.Tasks/TaskCompletionSource-1Type) | Represents the producer side of a task unbound to a delegate, providing access to the consumer side through the [`Task`](Microsoft.Coyote.Tasks/TaskCompletionSource-1/Task) property. |
| static class [TaskCompletionSource](Microsoft.Coyote.Tasks/TaskCompletionSourceType) | Represents the producer side of a task unbound to a delegate, providing access to the consumer side through the [`Task`](Microsoft.Coyote.Tasks/TaskCompletionSource-1/Task) property. |
| static class [TaskExtensions](Microsoft.Coyote.Tasks/TaskExtensionsType) | Extension methods for Task and Task objects. |

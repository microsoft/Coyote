## Microsoft.Coyote.Tasks namespace

| public type | description |
| --- | --- |
| class [AsyncLock](Microsoft.Coyote.Tasks/AsyncLockType) | A non-reentrant mutual exclusion lock that can be acquired asynchronously in a first-in first-out order. During testing, the lock is automatically replaced with a controlled mocked version. |
| class [ControlledTask&lt;TResult&gt;](Microsoft.Coyote.Tasks/ControlledTask-1Type) | Represents an asynchronous operation that can return a value. Each [`ControlledTask`](Microsoft.Coyote.Tasks/ControlledTask-1Type) is a thin wrapper over Task and each call simply invokes the wrapped task. During testing, a [`ControlledTask`](Microsoft.Coyote.Tasks/ControlledTaskType) is controlled by the runtime and systematically interleaved with other asynchronous operations to find bugs. |

| class [Semaphore](Microsoft.Coyote.Tasks/SemaphoreType) | A semaphore that limits the number of tasks that can access a resource. During testing, the semaphore is automatically replaced with a controlled mocked version. |
| static class [TaskExtensions](Microsoft.Coyote.Tasks/TaskExtensionsType) | Extension methods for Task and Task objects. |

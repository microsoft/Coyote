# ActorTestKit&lt;T&gt;.SendEventAsync method

Sends an event to the actor and starts its event handler. This method returns a task that completes when the actor reaches quiescence (typically when the event handler finishes executing because there are not more events to dequeue, or when the actor asynchronously waits to receive an event).

```csharp
public Task SendEventAsync(Event e)
```

## Return Value

Task that represents the asynchronous operation.

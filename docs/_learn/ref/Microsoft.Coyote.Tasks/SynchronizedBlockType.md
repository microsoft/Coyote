# SynchronizedBlock class

Provides a mechanism that synchronizes access to objects. It is implemented as a thin wrapper on Monitor. During testing, the implementation is automatically replaced with a controlled mocked version. It can be used as a replacement of the lock keyword to allow systematic testing.

```csharp
public class SynchronizedBlock : IDisposable
```

## Public Members

| virtual [Wait](SynchronizedBlock/Wait)(…) | Releases the lock on an object and blocks the current thread until it reacquires the lock. If the specified time-out interval elapses, the thread enters the ready queue. (2 methods) |

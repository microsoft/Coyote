# Specification.WhenTrue method

Creates a Task that will complete when *predicate* returns true. Invoking this method specifies a liveness property, which must be eventually satisfied during systematic testing, else the method throws an AssertionFailureException exception.

```csharp
public static Task WhenTrue(Func<Task<bool>> predicate, Func<int> getHashCode, TimeSpan delay, 
    CancellationToken cancellationToken = default(CancellationToken))
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| predicate | Function that specifies a liveness property that must be eventually satisfied. |
| getHashCode | Function that returns a hash used to track progress related to the liveness property. This is used only during systematic testing and must be lightweight as it is invoked frequently. |
| delay | The amount of time to delay between checks. This is not used during systematic testing. |
| cancellationToken | The cancellation token with which to complete the task. This is not used during systematic testing. |

## Return Value

Task that represents the property to be satisfied asynchronously.

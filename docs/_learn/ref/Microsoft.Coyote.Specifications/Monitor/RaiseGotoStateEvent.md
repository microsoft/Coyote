# Monitor.RaiseGotoStateEvent method (1 of 2)

Raise a special event that performs a goto state operation at the end of the current action.

```csharp
protected void RaiseGotoStateEvent(Type state)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| state | Type of the state. |

## Remarks

Goto state pops the current [`State`](../MonitorStateType) and pushes the specified [`State`](../MonitorStateType) on the active state stack. This is shorthand for the following code:

```csharp
class Event E { }
[OnEventGotoState(typeof(E), typeof(S))]
this.RaiseEvent(new E());
```

This event is not handled until the action that calls this method returns control back to the Coyote runtime. It is handled before any other events are dequeued from the inbox. Only one of the following can be called per action: [`RaiseEvent`](RaiseEvent), [`RaiseGotoStateEvent`](RaiseGotoStateEvent). An Assert is raised if you accidentally try and do two of these operations in a single action.

# Monitor class

Abstract class representing a specification monitor.

```csharp
public abstract class Monitor
```

## Public Members

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| override [ToString](Monitor/ToString)() | Returns a string that represents the current monitor. |
| abstract class [State](MonitorStateType) | Abstract class representing a state. |
| abstract class [StateGroup](MonitorStateGroupType) | Abstract class used for representing a group of related states. |
| struct [Transition](MonitorTransitionType) | Defines the [`Monitor`](MonitorType) transition that is the result of executing an event handler. Transitions are created by using [`GotoState`](Monitor/GotoState), or [`RaiseEvent`](Monitor/RaiseEvent). The Transition is processed by the Coyote runtime when an event handling method returns a Transition object. This means such a method can only do one such Transition per method call. If the method wants to do a conditional transition it can return Transition.None to indicate no transition is to be performed. |

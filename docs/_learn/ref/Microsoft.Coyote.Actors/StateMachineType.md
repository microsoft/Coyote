```

## Public Members

## Protected Members

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| [StateMachine](StateMachine/StateMachine)() | Initializes a new instance of the [`StateMachine`](StateMachineType) class. |
| [CurrentState](StateMachine/CurrentState) { get; } | Gets the Type of the current state. |
| override [OnEventHandledAsync](StateMachine/OnEventHandledAsync)(…) | Asynchronous callback that is invoked when the actor finishes handling a dequeued event, unless the handler of the dequeued event raised an event or caused the actor to halt (either normally or due to an exception).

| [RaiseGotoStateEvent](StateMachine/RaiseGotoStateEvent)(…) | Raise a special event that performs a goto state operation at the end of the current action. |
| [RaiseGotoStateEvent&lt;S&gt;](StateMachine/RaiseGotoStateEvent)() | Raise a special event that performs a goto state operation at the end of the current action. |
| override [RaiseHaltEvent](StateMachine/RaiseHaltEvent)() | Raises a [`HaltEvent`](HaltEventType) to halt the actor at the end of the current action. |
| [RaisePopStateEvent](StateMachine/RaisePopStateEvent)() | Raise a special event that performs a pop state operation at the end of the current action. |
| [RaisePushStateEvent](StateMachine/RaisePushStateEvent)(…) | Raise a special event that performs a push state operation at the end of the current action. |
| [RaisePushStateEvent&lt;S&gt;](StateMachine/RaisePushStateEvent)() | Raise a special event that performs a push state operation at the end of the current action. |

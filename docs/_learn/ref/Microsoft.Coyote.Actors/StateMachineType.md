# StateMachine class

Type that implements a state machine actor. Inherit from this class to declare a custom actor with states, state transitions and event handlers.

```csharp
public abstract class StateMachine : Actor
```

## Public Members

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| abstract class [State](StateMachineStateType) | Abstract class representing a state. |
| abstract class [StateGroup](StateMachineStateGroupType) | Abstract class used for representing a group of related states. |
| struct [Transition](StateMachineTransitionType) | Defines the [`StateMachine`](StateMachineType) transition that is the result of executing an event handler. Transitions are created by using [`GotoState`](StateMachine/GotoState), [`RaiseEvent`](StateMachine/RaiseEvent), [`PushState`](StateMachine/PushState) or [`PopState`](StateMachine/PopState) and [`Halt`](StateMachine/Halt). The Transition is processed by the Coyote runtime when an event handling method of a StateMachine returns a Transition object. This means such a method can only do one such Transition per method call. If the method wants to do a conditional transition it can return Transition.None to indicate no transition is to be performed. |

## Protected Members

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| [StateMachine](StateMachine/StateMachine)() | Initializes a new instance of the [`StateMachine`](StateMachineType) class. |
| [CurrentState](StateMachine/CurrentState) { get; } | Gets the Type of the current state. |
| [GotoState](StateMachine/GotoState)(…) | Creates a transition that pops the current [`State`](StateMachineStateType) and pushes the specified [`State`](StateMachineStateType) to the state stack at the end of the current action. |
| [GotoState&lt;S&gt;](StateMachine/GotoState)() | Creates a [`Transition`](StateMachineTransitionType) that pops the current [`State`](StateMachineStateType) and pushes the specified [`State`](StateMachineStateType) to the state stack at the end of the current action. |
| [Halt](StateMachine/Halt)() | Creates a transition that halts the state machine at the end of the current action. |
| override [OnEventHandledAsync](StateMachine/OnEventHandledAsync)(…) | Asynchronous callback that is invoked when the actor finishes handling a dequeued event, unless the handler of the dequeued event raised an event or caused the actor to halt (either normally or due to an exception). Unless this callback raises an event, the actor will either become idle or dequeue the next event from its inbox. |
| [PopState](StateMachine/PopState)() | Creates a transition that pops the current [`State`](StateMachineStateType) from the state stack at the end of the current action. |
| [PushState](StateMachine/PushState)(…) | Creates a transition that pushes the specified [`State`](StateMachineStateType) to the state stack at the end of the current action. |
| [PushState&lt;S&gt;](StateMachine/PushState)() | Creates a transition that pushes the specified [`State`](StateMachineStateType) to the state stack at the end of the current action. |
| [RaiseEvent](StateMachine/RaiseEvent)(…) | Creates a transition that raises the specified [`Event`](../Microsoft.Coyote/EventType) at the end of the current action. |

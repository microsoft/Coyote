# StateMachine.Transition structure

Defines the [`StateMachine`](StateMachineType) transition that is the result of executing an event handler. Transitions are created by using [`GotoState`](StateMachine/GotoState), [`RaiseEvent`](StateMachine/RaiseEvent), [`PushState`](StateMachine/PushState) or [`PopState`](StateMachine/PopState) and [`Halt`](StateMachine/Halt). The Transition is processed by the Coyote runtime when an event handling method of a StateMachine returns a Transition object. This means such a method can only do one such Transition per method call. If the method wants to do a conditional transition it can return Transition.None to indicate no transition is to be performed.

```csharp
public struct Transition
```

## Public Members

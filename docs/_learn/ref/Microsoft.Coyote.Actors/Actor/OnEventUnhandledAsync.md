# Actor.OnEventUnhandledAsync method

Asynchronous callback that is invoked when the actor receives an event that it is not prepared to handle. The callback is invoked first, after which the actor will necessarily throw an [`UnhandledEventException`](../UnhandledEventExceptionType)

```csharp
protected virtual Task OnEventUnhandledAsync(Event e, string state)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| e | The event that was unhandled. |
| state | The state when the event was dequeued. |

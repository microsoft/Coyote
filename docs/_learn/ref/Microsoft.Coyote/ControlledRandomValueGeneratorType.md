# ControlledRandomValueGenerator class

Provides static methods for generating random values. During testing, the random value generator is controlled by the tester, allowing the choices to be systematically explored.

```csharp
public static class ControlledRandomValueGenerator
```

## Public Members

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| static [GetNextBoolean](ControlledRandomValueGenerator/GetNextBoolean)() | Returns a nondeterministic boolean choice, that can be controlled during testing. |
| static [GetNextBoolean](ControlledRandomValueGenerator/GetNextBoolean)(…) | Returns a nondeterministic boolean choice, that can be controlled during testing. |
| static [GetNextInteger](ControlledRandomValueGenerator/GetNextInteger)(…) | Returns a nondeterministic integer, that can be controlled during testing. |

## How does it work?

The `coyote` test tool takes over the scheduling of a Coyote program. It is able to do this reliably
because it deeply understands the required [Coyote programming models](/coyote/learn/overview/what-is-coyote).
Therefore, the tester knows all concurrent operations in a test as well as sources of synchronization
between them. By controlling the scheduling, the tester can reliably explore different interleavings of
operations. The tester will repeatedly run a Coyote test, each time exercising different scheduling
choices. This methodology has proven to be very effective at providing high coverage, especially _concurrency_
coverage, in a short amount of time. In a similar way, the tester can also take over other sources of
non-determinism, such as the delivery of timeout messages or injection of failures.

If a bug is found, the Coyote tester reports a _reproducible_ bug trace that provides the global order of all
scheduling decisions and nondeterministic choices made during the execution of a test. The trace can be
replayed reliably over and over again, until the bug is identified. This makes a bug reported by the Coyote
 tester significantly easier to debug than regular unit-/integration-tests and logs from production or
 stress tests, which are typically nondeterministic. No more [Heisenbugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisenbug)!

The exact mechanism Coyote uses to do this depends on the programming model you have chosen. The Coyote
tester uses several state-of-the-art exploration strategies that have been known to find very deep bugs
easily. The tester runs a _portfolio_ of available strategies, maximizing chances of revealing bugs. Coyote
refers to these exploration strategies as _scheduling strategies_ and makes it easy to incorporate
new strategies, as they come out of research. New scheduling strategies are being developed in Microsoft
Research based on a wealth of experience gathered from the Microsoft product groups that are using Coyote
today. See [case studies](/coyote/case-studies/azure-batch-service).

See [animating state machine demo](/coyote/learn/programming-models/actors/state-machine-demo) for a visual explanation of what Coyote does
when it is looking for bugs.

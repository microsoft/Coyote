## Using timers in actors

The Coyote actor model has built-in support for timers.  Timers are themselves a type of `Actor` that
send a `TimerElapsedEvent` to the actor that created them upon timeout.  Timers are handy for modeling
a common type of asynchronous behavior in distributed systems, so you can find more bugs in your code
relating to how it deals with the uncertainty of various kinds of timeouts.

Timers support a once only timeout event and periodic timeouts, which can continually send such events
on a user-defined interval until they are stopped.

To make use of timers, you must include the `Microsoft.Coyote.Actors.Timers` namespace.
You can start a non-periodic timer using the function `StartTimer`.

```c#
TimerInfo StartTimer(TimeSpan startDelay, Event customEvent = null)
```

`StartTimer` takes as argument:
1. `TimeSpan startDelay`, which is the amount of time to wait before sending the timeout event.
3. `Event customEvent`, optional custom event to raise instead of the default TimerElapsedEvent.

`StartTimer` returns `TimerInfo`, which contains information about the created non-periodic timer. The
non-periodic timer is automatically disposed after it timeouts. You can also pass the `TimerInfo` to
the `StopTimer` method to manually stop and dispose the timer. The timer sends events of type
`TimerElapsedEvent` back to the inbox of the actor which created it. The `TimerElapsedEvent` contains
as payload, the same `TimerInfo` returned during the timer creation.
If you create multiple timers, then the `TimerInfo` object can be used
to distinguish the sources of the different `TimerElapsedEvent` events.

You can start a periodic timer using the function `StartPeriodicTimer`.

```c#
TimerInfo StartPeriodicTimer(TimeSpan startDelay, TimeSpan period, Event customEvent = null)
```

`StartPeriodicTimer` takes as argument:
1. `TimeSpan startDelay`, which is the amount of time to wait before sending the first timeout event.
2. `TimeSpan period`, which is the time interval between timeout events.
4. `Event customEvent`, optional custom event to raise instead of hte default TimerElapsedEvent.

Periodic timers work similarly to normal timers, however you need to manually stop a periodic timer
using the `StopTimer` method if you want it to stop sending `TimerElapsedEvent` events.
Note that when an actor [halts](termination), it automatically stops and disposes all
its periodic and non-periodic timers.

A sample which demonstrates the use of such timers is provided in the [Timers Sample](https://github.com/microsoft/coyote-samples/tree/master/Timers)
on github, which is explained in detail below.

First you need to declare on your Actor that it is expecting to receive the `TimerElapsedEvent` so the class is defined like this:

```c#
   [OnEventDoAction(typeof(TimerElapsedEvent), nameof(HandleTimeout))]
   internal class Client : Actor
   {
```

To kick things off the initialization method starts a non-periodic timer:

```c#
   protected override Task OnInitializeAsync(Event initialEvent)
   {
      Console.WriteLine("<Client> Starting a non-periodic timer");
      this.StartTimer(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1));
      return base.OnInitializeAsync(initialEvent);
   }
```

The `HandleTimeout` method then receives this timeout and starts a periodic timer as follows:

```c#
    private void HandleTimeout(Event e)
    {
        TimerElapsedEvent te = (TimerElapsedEvent)e;

        this.WriteMessage("<Client> Handling timeout from timer");

        this.WriteMessage("<Client> Starting a period timer");
        this.PeriodicTimer = this.StartPeriodicTimer(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1), TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1), new CustomTimerEvent());
    }
```

In this case we use a `CustomTimerEvent` instead of the default `TimerElapsedEvent`, this custom event is defined as follows:

```c#
    internal class CustomTimerEvent : TimerElapsedEvent
    {
        /// <summary>
        /// Count of timeout events processed.
        /// </summary>
        internal int Count;
    }
```

This custom event makes it possible to route the period timeouts to a different handler using this on the actor class:

```c#
    [OnEventDoAction(typeof(CustomTimerEvent), nameof(HandlePeriodicTimeout))]
```

In the HandlePeriodicTimeout method we count the number of timeouts and stop when we reach 3:

```c#
    private void HandlePeriodicTimeout(Event e)
    {
        this.WriteMessage("<Client> Handling timeout from periodic timer");
        if (e is CustomTimerEvent ce)
        {
            ce.Count++;
            if (ce.Count == 3)
            {
                this.WriteMessage("<Client> Stopping the periodic timer");
                this.StopTimer(this.PeriodicTimer);
            }
        }
    }
```

Notice how we can cast the `Event` into our custom `CustomTimerEvent`, and we get the same instance of `CustomTimerEvent`
on each period call, so this way the `CustomTimerEvent` can contain useful state, in this case the `Count`.

The output of this program is as follows:

```xml
<Client> Starting a non-periodic timer
<Client> Handling timeout from timer
<Client> Starting a period timer
<Client> Handling timeout from periodic timer
<Client> Handling timeout from periodic timer
<Client> Handling timeout from periodic timer
<Client> Stopping the periodic timer
```

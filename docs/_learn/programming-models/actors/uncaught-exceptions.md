## Semantics of unhandled exceptions

Coyote `Actors` can execute arbitrary C# code in their event handlers. This page discusses what happens if
such code throws an exception that is not handled inside the action itself. As is usual in
[asynchronous programming](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/parallel-programming/exception-handling-task-parallel-library), one should be careful with unhandled exceptions.

In test mode (i.e., when running a test with `coyote test ...`), all unhandled exceptions are an error
and the test will fail. The `coyote` tester will stop the execution at that point and report an error.

In production mode (i.e., when running a Coyote program in production), the Coyote runtime intercepts
any unhandled exception in an actor. The exception is then delivered to the `OnFailure`
delegate of the runtime. At this point, it is your responsibility to take the appropriate action. For
instance, you can cause the program to crash and create a dump (for debugging later) as follows:

```c#
runtime.OnFailure += delegate (Exception exception)
{
   Environment.FailFast(exception.ToString(), exception);
};
```

It is important that you induce a crash to stop the program, after perhaps taking some cleanup actions.
If you don't do so, the runtime automatically enters a "failure" mode. Actors may continue running
their current action, but no additional work will take place. The runtime stops all `Enqueue` and
`Dequeue` operations in the program. Thus, messages sent will not be delivered, and already-received
messages will not be dequeued. If you wish to suppress an exception and have the rest of the program
continue normal operation, then it is best to catch the exception in the action itself using a usual
`try { } catch { }` block, or override the actor's `OnException` method to handle exceptions in one
place.

## Call Stack and debugging

The runtime takes care to call the `OnFailure` delegate with the stack intact. That is, if you launch a
debugger from inside the `OnFailure` method, you will see the stack (with local variables) at the point
the exception was thrown. However, this is not always the case. If the exception was thrown from an
`async` action, then the stack may have gotten unwound even before the runtime gets to know of
the exception (because of the way `async` continuations get compiled).

## Testing async/await code using Coyote machines

The Coyote language was designed to ease the development of event-driven programs. Coyote forces the
programmer to think of their design in terms of state machines driven by events passed back-and-forth
between them. This style lends itself naturally to the asynchronous world. Tasks are kept short and
their continuations are stitched together through events that arrive asynchronously. The complexity of
testing and exploration is managed by the `coyote` tester that systematically enumerates different
interleavings and provides high "concurrency" coverage. While the intended use-case of Coyote is for
the development of new systems, we do acknowledge that the more common need is going to be for testing
of existing code. Can Coyote help there? We think so, especially for code that is primarily
`async`-`await` C#. But we first need to understand how `coyote` tester works.

## Coyote Tester Requirements

In Coyote, a `StateMachine` is the unit the concurrency. It represents a _state machine_, but for the
purpose of this article, we can ignore this aspect of a `StateMachine` and simply treat it as a building
block for concurrency, similar to a `Task` or a `Thread`. A `StateMachine` is internally sequential but
different `Machines` all execute concurrently. A `StateMachine` is always in an event-driven loop until it
halts; it waits for an event to arrive in its `Inbox` and fires an `action` in response. The `action`,
in addition to calling Coyote APIs for sending and receiving events, can execute _arbitrary_ `C#` code
to mutate the state of the program. It is this usage of _arbitrary_ that we must now understand for
using `coyote` on existing code.

In the simplest form, the `C#` code should be sequential so that all concurrency is delegated to the
Coyote runtime (at least while testing). In other words, the code executed by a machine action must
not spawn `Tasks` or `Threads` neither must it do any synchronization operation other than the Coyote
`SendEvent` or `ReceiveEventAsync` (i.e., no use of `locks`, `mutexes` or similar constructs).
This goes along with the recommendation that different `Machines` must not share object references
(use [Shared Objects](/coyote/learn/advanced/object-sharing) if you must).

The reason for all these restrictions is that `coyote` tester needs to be aware of all
concurrency in the program in order to control it. The `coyote` tester keeps track of all
live state machines in the program and takes over the scheduling. At any point during the execution
of the program, it will determine the next `StateMachine` to schedule and give it a chance to execute.
The machine will execute its action without interference from other machines until it finishes its current action or it enters the Coyote runtime again via a `SendEvent` or `ReceiveEventAsync`
(the only available synchronization primitives). At this point, the `coyote` tester scheduler
takes control, suspends the currently-scheduled machine and then decides on the next one to schedule.
The `coyote` tester essentially serializes the entire execution to a single thread. By controlling the
scheduling decisions during an execution, `coyote` can explore different interleavings for a program.
The exact choice of which `StateMachine` to schedule is determined by a `SchedulingStrategy`.
The `coyote` tester has several strategies and we recommend using a
portfolio of them. The strategies
have been crafted from over a decade of research on finding concurrency bugs efficiently in practice.
(See, for example, [this paper](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2786861).)

Despite serializing the execution on a single thread, the restrictions that we had outlined above
guarantee that `coyote` will cover all behaviors of the program in the limit. Getting there will
of course, take infinite time because there may be infinitely many executions of the program,
nonetheless, _completeness-in-the-limit_ is an important guarantee for a testing solution to have.
(Testing concurrent programs natively on the hardware without `coyote` does not offer this
guarantee.)

Relaxing the restrictions on the `C#` code can either cause `coyote` to lose completeness or it
may start to deadlock or crash. The former outcome is the acceptable one: we still dramatically gain
testing coverage by using the `coyote` tester over na√Øve testing. (It also makes way for a
pay-as-you-go-model: as more code is made Coyote-compliant, the coverage keeps improving and
fully-Coyote-compliant code offers completeness.) It is the latter (deadlocks and crashes)
that we must avoid.

## Async-Await Code

To make the discussion meaningful, we restrict our attention to mostly `async`-`await` code. By this we
mean a software component that asynchronously handles client requests that may arrive at any time, and
sends back a response when it's done servicing them. Internally, it may use other such components: it
delegates work to them asynchronously and waits for their response. Such components are typical in web
services, where for example, users pump in requests at any time and the service must process them
asynchronously; it cannot afford to block subsequent requests before it finishes the first. Further,
the service might use a backing store for persistence and fault tolerance. Let's take an example.
Suppose that our component offers the following methods for processing client requests:

```C#
async Task<Response> HandleRequest1(...);
async Task<Response> HandleRequest2(...);
```

And these procedures call external methods for interacting with a persistent store:

```C#
async Task<Data> Read(int index);
async Task Write(int index, Data data);
```

For unit-testing such code, one might write a test method that invokes these methods in parallel and
use mocks of the storage that relies on locking to be thread-safe.

```C#
void Test()
{
   Task.Run(async () => await HandleRequest1(...));
   Task.Run(async () => await HandleRequest2(...));
}

// mock
async Task<Data> Read(int index)
{
   lock(lck)
   {
      return Task.FromResult(...);
   }
}
```

Note: Similar scenarios also exist very commonly inside the operating systems such as
[drivers](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/b8/2011/08/22/building-robust-usb-3-0-support/),
but the language of choice there is `C` or `C++`, not a managed language like `C#`.
Use [P](https://github.com/p-org/P) if you operate in that world.

## Testing Strategy

To use the `coyote` tester we must tame the `C#` code and work towards exposing the concurrency
to Coyote. First and foremost, _the code must not spawn `Tasks` (same applies to `Threads`)_.
This is the most important rule to follow. Creation of `Tasks` will surely make `coyote` unusable.
To eliminate `Task` creation, try replacing them with `StateMachine` creation instead, which should
work for the most part. For our running example, we modify our `Test` method to instead
create machines:

```C#
[Microsoft.Coyote.TestingServices.Test]
void Test(IActorRuntime runtime)
{
   runtime.CreateActor(typeof(RunTask), new TaskPayload(async () => await HandleRequest1(...)));
   runtime.CreateActor(typeof(RunTask), new TaskPayload(async () => await HandleRequest2(...)));
}
```

Here, `RunTask` is a special machine that simply invokes the payload method given to it. Look at the
sample [here](https://github.com/p-org/CoyoteLab/tree/master/Samples/Experimental/SingleTaskMachine). 
Or one may create their own special machine for invoking `HandleRequest1` or
`HandleRequest2`. Any way of replacing `Task` creation with `StateMachine` creation is fine.

Another example: your code may be using a `Timer` to register a periodic callback. Instead, create a
`TimerMachine` that either invokes the callback periodically (or non-deterministically using Coyote's
`Random`) or sends an event to the `Task` (now a `StateMachine`) that created the `Timer`. Sample code is
[here](https://github.com/p-org/coyote/tree/master/Samples/Raft/Raft.CoyoteLibrary/Timers).

Once the `Task` creation is eliminated, the next item of focus is the use of synchronization. When
multiple `Tasks` can share a reference to the same object, they will use synchronization in the form of
`locks` to guard access to that object. When `Tasks` get converted to `Machines`, this implies actions
of different machines might share objects and invoke non-Coyote synchronization. For `coyote`
scheduling to work without causing deadlocks, one must be careful with such synchronization. _A simple
rule of thumb is that a Coyote API should not be invoked while holding a lock_. Short synchronization
blocks that guard access to a flag or a simple container should be likely be fine, except that `coyote`
loses completeness (practically, there is a loss in coverage). To regain more coverage,
_consider lifting the synchronization blocks to be hosted in their own `StateMachine`_. For our running
example, we can write a machine `StorageMachine` to mock calls to `Read` and `Write` and do something
like the following instead of locking:

```C#
async Task<Data> Read(int index)
{
   SendEvent(typeof(StorageMachine), new ReadEvent(index));
   var r = await ReceiveEventAsync(typeof(ReadResponse));
   return r.Data;
}
```

The `StorageMachine` can perform `Read` and `Write` functionality atomically (without needing to grab a
lock as `coyote` guarantees methods of a single machine are not executed in parallel). This mocking
will ensure the `coyote` tester considers different orders of execution of the `Read/Write` critical
section.

There are further standard guidelines to writing a Coyote test. _The test must be idempotent and set up
for repeated execution_. In simple terms, it must reset its state before starting the test. This is
required because the `coyote` tester execute the test method repeatedly.

If you have code that mostly uses `async`-`await` constructs then it would be an easy porting exercise,
which may just be confined to your test code. A detailed account of how we applied this strategy to
test the `ExtentManager` of Azure Storage vNext is given in our
[paper](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/paper-1.pdf)
(see section 3).

## Controlled Non-Determinism

There is an additional requirement for the `coyote` tester. The C# code must be deterministic once the
concurrent interleaving between `Machines` is fixed. This means, for instance, the code should not make
branching decisions based on the current time. In order to simulate timeout, you can instead rely on the
Coyote runtime `Random` API, which in turn will provide higher coverage during testing (by exploring
both the non-timeout as well as timeout scenarios). This requirement is necessary to reproduce a trace
reported by the `coyote` tester but can also help in achieving higher coverage. Some of the `coyote`
tester strategies rely on controlled non-determinism to systematically explore different interleavings.

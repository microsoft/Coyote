## Vision

With Coyote we envision a future where developing software with any form of concurrency is as
natural as developing sequential code. We want to demystify concurrency issues, be it with
design, testing, or debugging---be it with single-box systems or large distributed
systems.

Through rapid design-implement-test cycles, Coyote empowers developers with a quantum leap in
productivity. The technology provides programming frameworks that reduce the gap between design
and implementation and offers unmatched testing capabilities for weeding out bugs early.

## Origin story

Grounded on years of experience in formal methods and software engineering at Microsoft
Research, Coyote's inspiration springs from recognizing the ironic absence of tooling for
developing concurrent systems.

Despite concurrency being a fundamental paradigm of computer science (all layers of a
computer system are concurrent, starting from the hardware to the operating system, to
applications, distributed systems, and cloud) not much attention has previously been given to
the problem of testing these systems for correctness. Current practices dictate that unit tests
be deterministic, often leading to the oblique art of stress testing to weed out bugs.

Our initial thinking was to simply build tools focused on testing, but we quickly realized
any technique focused only on testing would have severely limited value: developers want to
write elegant, correct, and performant code on the first go---they don't want to be tracing
buggy interleavings late into the wee hours.

With this broader vision, Coyote's programming models marry design, implementation, and
testing for remarkable productivity. Coyote is the evolution of the P# project that got us
started on this journey, building over years of research in concurrency design and
implementation bugs.

From the moment various Azure teams began using Coyote, we've been receivingÂ enthusiastic
feedback. What started as one service built with Coyote has now expanded to more than ten and
growing.

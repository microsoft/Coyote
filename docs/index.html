  - title: Auto-discover bugs
    content: |
        <p>Use Coyote to automatically find and reproduce deep nondeterministic bugs (e.g. due to concurrency, failures or timeouts) in your asynchronous C# code.</p>
        <p> After a bug is found, Coyote enables you to deterministically replay bug-traces using Visual Studio’s debugger.</p>

                    <h3>Azure Batch Service</h3>
                    <p> This team wanted to invest in a new architecture of multiple microservices that would reliably scale to meet the demands of their popular cloud-scale job-scheduling service. Each microservice had to: </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Process requests asynchronously as they arrived. </li>
                            <li>Support cancellation of an in-flight request, enabling quick turnaround for auto-scaling.</li>
                            <li>Be resilient to failures of virtual machines hosting the service. </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Choosing Coyote, the team experienced a previously unheard-of end-to-end test coverage, discovered hard-to-find bugs in a matter of minutes, and saved months of developer time. </p>

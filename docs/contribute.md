The Coyote team is looking for interns who are ready to put inquiry and theory into practice in a vibrant startup environment.

This is an opportunity for doctoral candidates to work alongside some of the world’s best researchers, with the goal of making Coyote the developer’s choice for building highly reliable asynchronous systems.

Internships are offered year-round and are paid. We’ll also help with visa applications, as needed.

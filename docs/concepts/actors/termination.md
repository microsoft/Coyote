## Explicit termination of an actor

Coyote actors and state machines continue running unless they are explicitly terminated. The runtime
will mark an actor as idle if it has no work to do, but it will not reclaim any resources held by the
actor unless it is terminated. An actor is terminated when it performs the `Halt` operation, as seen
in the following example:

```csharp
private class Example : Actor
{
    private void SomeAction()
    {
        if (this.timeToStop)
        {
            this.Halt();
        }
    }

    protected override Task OnHaltAsync(Event e)
    {
        // Do some cleanup on halt.
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}
```

Additionally, an actor can be halted by another actor by sending a special built-in event called
`HaltEvent`. On state machines this event can also be used for self termination using `RaiseEvent`.
Termination of an actor due to an unhandled `HaltEvent` event is valid behavior (the Coyote runtime
does not report an error). An event sent to a halted actor is simply dropped. A halted actor cannot
be restarted; it remains halted forever.

The Coyote runtime implements actor termination efficiently by cleaning up resources allocated to a
halted actor and recording that the actor has halted.

Actor termination via `Halt` is an asynchronous operation. So in failover scenarios where you need
to be sure an actor is fully terminated before creating it's replacement actor, you will need to
create a handshake callback event sent from `OnHaltAsync` telling the caller that the actor has
officially halted, otherwise there will be a brief period of time where both actors are alive which
may not be what you want when modeling a failover situation. This is shown in the [test
failover](../../tutorials/actors/test-failover.md) tutorial.

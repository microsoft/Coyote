Value that controls the probability of triggering a timeout each time Int32) or a built-in timer is scheduled during systematic testing. Decrease the value to increase the frequency of timeouts (e.g. a value of 1 corresponds to a 50% probability), or increase the value to decrease the frequency (e.g. a value of 10 corresponds to a 10% probability). By default this value is 10.

```csharp
public uint TimeoutDelay { get; }

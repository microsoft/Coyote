# SynchronizedBlock class

Provides a mechanism that synchronizes access to objects. It is implemented as a thin wrapper on Monitor. During testing, the implementation is automatically replaced with a controlled mocked version. It can be used as a replacement of the lock keyword to allow systematic testing.

```csharp
public class SynchronizedBlock : IDisposable
```

# AsyncLock.AcquireAsync method

Tries to acquire the lock asynchronously, and returns a task that completes when the lock has been acquired. The returned task contains a releaser that releases the lock when disposed. This is not a reentrant operation.

```csharp
public virtual Task<Releaser> AcquireAsync()
```

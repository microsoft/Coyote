# AsyncLock class

A non-reentrant mutual exclusion lock that can be acquired asynchronously in a first-in first-out order. During testing, the lock is automatically replaced with a controlled mocked version.

```csharp
public class AsyncLock
```

## Public Members

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| static [Create](AsyncLock/Create.md)() | Creates a new mutual exclusion lock. |
| virtual [AcquireAsync](AsyncLock/AcquireAsync.md)() | Tries to acquire the lock asynchronously, and returns a task that completes when the lock has been acquired. The returned task contains a releaser that releases the lock when disposed. This is not a reentrant operation. |
| struct [Releaser](AsyncLock.Releaser.md) | Releases the acquired AsyncLock when disposed. |

## Protected Members

| name | description |
| --- | --- |

| [IsAcquired](AsyncLock/IsAcquired.md) { get; set; } | True if the lock has been acquired, else false. |
| readonly [Awaiters](AsyncLock/Awaiters.md) | Queue of tasks awaiting to acquire the lock. |

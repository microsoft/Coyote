Coyote is a set of libraries and tools for building reliable asynchronous software. Coyote ensures
design and code remain in sync, dramatically simplifying the addition of new features. Coyote comes
with a systematic testing engine that allows finding and deterministically reproducing
hard-to-find safety and liveness bugs.

Coyote is used by several teams in [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) to design, implement and
systematically test production distributed systems and services. In the words of an Azure service
architect:
> Coyote found several issues early in the dev process, this sort of issues that would usually bleed
> through into production and become very expensive to fix later.

See our [documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/coyote/) for more information about the project,
case studies, tutorials and reference documentation.

Coyote is made with :heart: by Microsoft Research and is the evolution of the [P#
project](https://github.com/p-org/PSharp).

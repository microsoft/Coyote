Coyote (previously known as [P#](https://github.com/p-org/PSharp)) is a programming
framework for building reliable asynchronous software.
Coyote ensures design and code remain in sync, dramatically simplifying the
addition of new features.
Coyote comes with with a systematic testing engine that allows finding and
deterministically reproducing hard-to-find safety and liveness bugs.

Coyote is used by several teams in [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) to design,
implement and systematically test production distributed systems and services.
In the words of an Azure Service Architect:
> Coyote found several issues early in the dev process, this sort of issues that would
> usually bleed through into production and become very expensive to fix later
